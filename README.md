#DX Framework

This project was builded for learning porpouses, it's not meant to be used at all. The code it's based on the one provided with the book "Advance 3D Game Programming with DirectX 10", Peter Walsh.
Hopefully will help someone to understand a little more about Computer Graphics Programming.


Building for the first time:
- To complete the first build you need to copy the entire DirectX SDK (July 2010) to the 3DApp/DX folder.
- Also you need to copy D3DX10d_43.dll (inside DevRun) to the corresponding 3DApp/Build/bin folder created after building.


This is how you showld be seeing you DX folder.
```
3DApp
